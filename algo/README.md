# Algo

This folder contains various algorithm implementations. The algorithms included here are relatively 
simple and straightforward. More complex algorithms are implemented in separate folders for better 
organization.

## Languages
- Python
- C
- C++

## Note
Each source code file contains detailed comments at the top explaining the algorithm's:
- Purpose
- Time/Space complexity
- Usage examples
- Key implementation details

For more complex algorithm implementations, please check the dedicated folders.
