# RuPoemGPT

![header](header.png)

RuPoemGPT is a reimplementation of the original [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) project by Andrej Karpathy. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and some python scripts used for model reconstructure and training. Core features such as character-level language modeling and a simple neural network for generating text are preserved. The core difference lies in the dataset, the model was trained on - the collection of russian poems was used. This project is particularly beneficial for those interested in natural language processing and serves as a practical platform for exploring text generation.

### Example Usage

A real usage example of the existing model will be described soon. Currently it's in development mode.

**Example:**

```python

```

### Development

To run the project locally, you need to install the dependencies and run the main script. Alternatively, you can run jupyter notebooks.
