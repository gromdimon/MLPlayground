# pushgpt: A GPT Model for Russian Poetry Generation

## Introduction
pushgpt is a custom GPT model specifically trained on a dataset of Russian poems. This project aims to explore the capabilities of GPT in understanding and generating Russian poetic text, offering unique insights into AI-driven creativity in the realm of literature.

## Requirements and Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (list the libraries needed)

### Installation
Provide detailed instructions on how to set up the environment and install any necessary dependencies.

## Usage
### Running the Model
Explain how to run the model using `run.py`.

### Training the Model
Detail the process for training the model with `train.py`.

### Experimentation and Analysis
Describe how to use the Jupyter Notebooks (`RuPoemGPT.ipynb`, `gpt_dev_copy.ipynb`, `RuPoemGPT_old.ipynb`) for further experimentation and analysis.

## Dataset
Provide details about the Russian poems dataset used for training, including its source, size, and any preprocessing steps.

## Model Architecture
Explain the architecture of your GPT model, as defined in `model.py`.

## Results and Evaluation
Share insights, results, or metrics demonstrating the model's performance in generating Russian poetry.
